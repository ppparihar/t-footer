## Test Cases

- 

## Steps to Start
- Set Github repository at your end for this project, we will merge them later
- You can use Google/Vaadin's elements (like calender element and textboxes etc.)
- You can use some Tavisca's elements like auto-suggest if required from https://github.com/atomelements/t-autosuggest but all the features and properties mentioned in scope should be added. (Fork the existing element and create V2)

## Performance standard
- Any component if opened via [web page tester](https://www.webpagetest.org/), it should load under 500ms (milli seconds).
